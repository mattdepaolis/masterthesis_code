# Code created for the Master Thesis
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook files created for the master thesis: 
### Deep Learning-based Detection of Photovoltaic Installations: A Case Study in the Canton of Zurich.

The notebooks are divided into directories for data preparation and files for modeling.  
The YAML files used for the modeling are also available in the corresponding folder.

## Note:
Some of the notebooks were created with ChatGPT in order to save time and resources, especially in tasks like visualization, and to be able to compensate for the author's lack of software knowledge. Especially in the area of geodata manipulation, ChatGPT proved to be extremely helpful. The use of ChaTGPT is indicated in the header of the corresponding notebooks
